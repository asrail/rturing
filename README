= rturing: a Turing machine simulator written in Ruby

rturing simulates Turing machines designed to replace the dead and almost
uncompilable gturing[http://freshmeat.net/projects/gturing/].

_TODO_: _write_ _a_ _little_ _bit_ _about_ _Turing_ _machines_ _and_
_gturing_.

== Getting started

This section explains how to use rturing. We assume we can use any plain text
editor to write the Turing machines that will be simulated by rturing. Please
see Turing::Machine for details in the input file format.

=== Command-line interface

You must invoke rturing passing to it two arguments:

* first, the filename of a input Turing machine in the proper format.
* the contents of the input tape that will be processed by the machine.

rturing will read the machine's transition function from the informed file and
will process your input tape. Each step of the evaluation process is shown in
the terminal, by printing both the tape's state and the position of the
machine's head.

Example:

 $ rturing machines/add.tur 01010
 01010
