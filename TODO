A pretty imense TODO file:

=If we plan to release 0.1.3:

==Another simple thing: to use a checkbox to revert the moviment, instead
   of using negative values to the timeout (have you seen the math code?)
=== caio: top, deixa algo simples pra mim, favor :P.

=More complex tasks:
==To use Gtk::Action for every action, so we can enable and desable
   then. It will help us with most of the GUI improvements we need.
=== I, caio, am in the middle of this task.

==Then... this is more for designers than programmers, but we *have to*
   use labels and tooltips for everything. We should follow
   interface accessibility guidelines.
=== Eu me propus a fazer isso, acho que Top n√£o gosta disso...


TOLATER:
=Much more complex tasks:
==Port the graphics to gnomecanvas.
