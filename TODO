A pretty imense TODO file:

=If we plan to release 0.1.3:
==We still allowing a tape infinite for just one side to go left... also
   we have to test the tapes more exaustively.

==To treat '_' as true blankspaces (we don't accept spaces, we may
   fake). It's ugly to see the _____ in the tape. It would be bad to
   check with our current model.

==Another simple thing: to use a checkbox to revert the moviment, instead
   of using negative values to the timeout (have you seen the math code?)

=More complex tasks:
==To use Gtk::Action for every action, so we can enable and desable
   then. It will help us with most of the GUI improvements we need.

==Then... this is more for designers than programmers, but we *have to*
   use labels and tooltips for everything. We should follow
   interface accessibility guidelines.

==We may start using scrollbars, even if we have to limit the
   size. 648x480 is too much for our simple interface.


TOLATER:
=Much more complex tasks:
==Port the graphics to gnomecanvas.

==To make a pretty fucking TMEGUI.



OBS: Please, read the last logs in adition to this.
