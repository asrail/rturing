A pretty imense TODO file:

To use Gtk::Action for every action, so we can enable and desable
   then. It will help us with most of the GUI improvements we need.

Then... this is more for designers than programmers, but we *have to*
   use labels and tooltips for everything. We should follow
   interface accessibility guidelines.

We still allowing a tape infinite for just one side to go left... also
   we have to test the tapes more exaustively.

Another simple thing: to use a checkbox to revert the movent, instead
   of using negative values to the timeout (have you seen the math code?)

We may start using scrollbars, even if we have to limit the
   size. 648x480 is too much for our simple interface.


TOLATER:
Port the graphics to gnomecanvas.

To make a pretty fucking TMEGUI.



OBS: Please, read the last logs in adition to this.
