== Sample files

rturing was develop to replace gturing, thus it was designed to read and write
the same file format of gturing. This way, we distribute some gturing's ones
together with new ones written by ourselves.

The following files were taken from gturing:

* <tt>3ones2zeroes.tur</tt>
* <tt>addbin.tur</tt>
* <tt>add.tur</tt>
* <tt>bb2.tur</tt>
* <tt>bb3.tur</tt>
* <tt>bb5.tur</tt>
* <tt>bin2dec_shift.tur</tt>
* <tt>bin2dec.tur</tt>
* <tt>dashnumbers.tur</tt>
* <tt>dec2bin_shift.tur</tt>
* <tt>dec2bin.tur</tt>
* <tt>sort.tur</tt>
* <tt>subst.tur</tt>
